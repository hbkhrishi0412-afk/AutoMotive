# Deployment Guide

## Issues Fixed

The following issues have been resolved to enable successful deployment:

### 1. Import Map Conflict
- **Problem**: The `index.html` had an import map that conflicted with bundled React dependencies
- **Solution**: Removed the import map from `index.html`

### 2. Database Dependencies
- **Problem**: The app used `better-sqlite3` and `sqlite3` which are Node.js native modules that don't work in Vercel's serverless environment
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed database dependencies from `package.json`
  - The app already had `DatabaseServiceClient` that uses localStorage as fallback
  - Fixed import errors in service files

### 3. Vercel Configuration
- **Problem**: Outdated Vercel configuration format
- **Solution**: Updated `vercel.json` to use modern Vercel configuration format

## Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Deploy via Vercel CLI
1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Run: `vercel --prod`

### Option 2: Deploy via GitHub
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your repository to Vercel
3. Vercel will automatically detect the Vite framework and deploy

### Option 3: Deploy via Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Import your GitHub repository
4. Vercel will auto-detect the configuration

## Environment Variables

Make sure to set the following environment variable in Vercel:
- `API_KEY`: Your Google Gemini API key

## What's Working Now

✅ Build process completes successfully  
✅ No conflicting dependencies  
✅ Proper Vercel configuration  
✅ API routes configured for serverless deployment  
✅ Client-side data persistence via localStorage  

## Notes

- The app now uses localStorage for data persistence instead of SQLite
- All database operations fall back to localStorage automatically
- The app is fully functional in the browser without server-side database
